## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Among the things I was able to learn and practice in this project are: the use of background-image to show images as background, as well as changing it through media queries; including icons in buttons, using different typographies.

Here are some examples:

```html
<div class="image-container"></div>
```
```css
.image-container {
    background-image: url(../img/image-product-mobile.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}
```
```html
<div class="button">
  <img src="img/icon-cart.svg" alt="Icon Cart">
  <a href="#">Add to Cart</a>
</div>
```

```css
.button {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    column-gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

This is my second project done on this platform, I will continue to apply what I have learned in the following projects, and take advantage of each of the challenges, because you always learn something new and correct mistakes made in previous projects.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
